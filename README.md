A task squashing tool, written with pyGTK, that loosely is based on ideas from GTD and Kanban. It reads tasks from a Zim Desktop Wiki files and allows you to log your task squashing activity.

For now:
- Only the Lite version is usable (run it with $python taskSquashLite.py)
- The Naive Bayes classifier still is buggy
